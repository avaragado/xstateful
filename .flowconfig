# for third-party modules that use flow, you need to let flow do its thing:
# so you shouldn't ignore the entirety of node_modules.
# however, you might have to adjust the [ignore] etc sections HERE
# to account for what those modules need. for example, if a module
# uses a magic marker to ignore certain flow errors, you need to include
# that magic string HERE too.
